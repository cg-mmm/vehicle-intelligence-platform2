Output MUST be pure JSON matching the ModuleBlock[] TypeScript union provided (no markdown, no prose outside JSON). Keep to factual, generic, non-defamatory statements. For quizzes, include explanations. For calculators, prefer sensible defaults derived from the article when possible.`

- Subtitle: "${article?.hero?.subheadline || ""}"
- Badges: ${JSON.stringify(article?.hero?.badges || [])}
- Content: ${articleContent.substring(0, 2000)}

Required modules (return as an array in this order if possible):
1) { "type": "tldr" } – 3-6 sentence summary.
2) { "type": "key_takeaways" } – 3-7 bullets of concrete insights (no fluff).
3) { "type": "mpg_calculator" } – include defaults using any MPG mentioned; otherwise leave defaults empty.
4) { "type": "quiz" } – 3-5 multiple-choice questions about the page's content; each with 4 choices, one correctIndex, brief explanation.
5) { "type": "pull_quote" } – 1 impactful buyer-oriented quote (no brand slander).
6) { "type": "dropdown" } – 2-3 expandable sections (e.g., "Which model is best for commuters?", "Which offers most cargo space?"); titles should be concise; body 1-3 paragraphs.
7) { "type": "reviews" } – 2-4 short synthesized review blurbs (generic, non-branded sources unless sources provided), optional rating 3.5–5.0, optional pros/cons arrays.

Output rules:
- Return ONLY valid JSON array of ModuleBlock objects.
- No markdown fences. No keys outside the schema.
- Avoid hallucinating exact prices/MPG/horsepower beyond the input; if unsure, generalize.
- Keep copy tight, scannable, and consistent with a professional dealer content tone.`
